→ When grouped by site, site d shows the highest mean age, while mean BMI and systolic blood pressure remain relatively consistent across all sites.
→ The mean outcome_CVD rate is highest in the control group, whereas mean adherence percentage is greatest for treatment b.
→ The outcome_CVD and PCT values are relatively consistent across all groups.
